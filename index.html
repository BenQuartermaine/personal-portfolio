        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Have at it.

<!-- WORK SECTION -->
        <h3 class="sub-header">Work</h3>
        <p class="body-content">
          Some projects I have done using React.js include <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://benquartermaine.github.io/react-giphy/">Gify</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://build-he0uaz463.now.sh">Catch of The Day.</a> Both are deployed and in operation.
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          With focus on different aspects of UX, I have completed the following pieces of work. MoFarm: Rural China research guide, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@BQWA/mirror-fashion-ux-case-study-c1a593ee7be0">Mirror Fashion</a> and a teardown of Envato Tuts+. These three projects emphasize my thought process and UX principal application.
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          I’ve also helped build a few WeChat Mini Programs, most notably <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@BQWA/wechat-mini-program-mindrock-cdc04d241055">MindRock</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Currently I am working on a personal project called theUXof.xyz. A series of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/creating-useronboard-teardowns-my-process-and-tools--cms-23232">teardowns</a> that explore the user experience of individuals, businesses and products and what makes them delightful (or not!).

<!-- BACKGROUND SECTION -->
        <h3 class="sub-header">Background</h3>
        <p class="body-content">
          I got my start in product design at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://mandalagroup.org">Mandala Group</a>, a company I co-founded in China with two highly inspirational individuals. During my time at Mandala Group I undertook two key roles. The first was programs co-ordinator. We ran 4-week idea incubation programs that allowed entrepreneurs, designers and coders from all across the world to come to China and work on one of our current projects.
        </p>

        <p class="body-content">
          The second role was product designer. Leading a small team of researchers and designers through rural Hunan, we spent weeks at a time collecting data, interviewing villagers and synthesizing these trips into tangible design briefs. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          As a group we focused heavily on finding solutions for the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-behind_children_in_China">Left Behind Children</a> issue. The result was <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/mandalagroup.org/videos/2435534026672788/" target="_blank">MoFarm</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Quickly I learnt that understanding the problem space is one aspect, but being able to clearly communicate the problem space to the development team was equally as important. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Acknowledging this I have recently undertaken <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon’s</a> full-stack coding bootcamp to bridge my own knowledge gap between tech and design.
        </p>  
        <p class="body-content">
           I amn currently based in Melbourne, Australia where I am seeking a full-time frontend developer position in a mission oriented company. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
           I'm also available for React.js projects and to build sweet little one pager websites like this one.
        </p>

<!-- OTHER THAN WORK SECTION -->
        <h3 class="sub-header">Other than work</h3>
          <p class="body-content">
            I like to rock climb (the kind without a harness), surf and stay pretty active. I’m a huge believer in screen-free time and interacting with green spaces—living in Shanghai has drilled this luxury home!
          </p> 
          <p class="body-content">
            I enjoy cooking and am currently burning my way through <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.harpercollins.com.au/9781460751886/bills-everyday-asian/">Bill’s Everyday Asian</a>, and love to step around and smash coffee’s on the weekends.
          </p> 
          <p class="body-content">
            I put a lot of time into learning Mandarin, so I aggressively try to maintain this skill by learning <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXdYi2mHBjI" target="_blank">chinese love songs</a>.
