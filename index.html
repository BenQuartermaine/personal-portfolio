            Mirror is an established fashion brand that caters to the everyday clothing needs of children through 65 year olds. The design breif consisted of overhauling their brand identity and to help establish an online e-commerce presence to support their brick and mortar operations.

          <p>Five in-person interviews were conducted. The age range was 22 to 28 with a gender break down of three females and two males. From these interviews I understood 5 things:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Online option overload is a barrier to purchasing.</li> 
          <li>Product filters are important.</li>
          <li>Browsing online and purchasing offline is common.</li>
          <li>“Would the clothing fit?”</li> 
          <li>Ease of purchasing and discounts are factors in brand loyalty.</li>

        <h4>Branding & Color</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="case-content">
        <p>Based on user research, 80% of the sample base stated that they really liked clean and minimalist interfaces.</p>
        <p>The core colors chosen were navy blue and a complementary maroon which symbolize depth and tradition. I coupled these with shades of grey and used the core colors sparingly to enable the negative space and photography to stand out.</p>
        <p>The typography selection of a sans-serif font (montserrat) was made to give a fresh feel to the website and break away from the traditonal feeling a serif font can give.</p>
        <p>The message of these selections is that Mirror is an established brand that is in touch with the times. Mirror is showcasing to their existing consumer base that they’re a progressive retailer that is rooted in the fundamentals that made their brand strong.</p>

          <p>The hi-fidelity wireframes were linked together using InVision and tested on a new set of users.</p>
          <p>User testing uncovered two issues—Design inconsistency’s regarding the “add to bag” page were noted by most and trouble with the design tool and the fact that only a certain user flow could be accessed.</p>
          <p>The second was an issue of time, the first however could be rectified easily.</p>

        <p>There are a few things I would improve with this case study:</p>
        <p>For interviews I would like to first hand watch a users interaction with purchasing a product online.</p>
        <p>For user testing, encouraging a higher level of commentary from the user, and asking probing questions about each page as the test progressed. Also some kind of warm-up activity or question to put the user at ease. I noticed that most seemed unsure and reserved in their actions and statements.</p>

         <p>MindRock is a WeChat Mini Program that pushes users outside of their comfort zone through 7-day daily challenges.</p>
         <p>Challenges can be completed individually but are encouraged to be completed as part of a team for a high level of accountability and interaction.</p>
         <p>You can record how your challenge goes each day, what roadblocks did you face? Was day 2 easier than day 1?</p>
         <p>You can also see your history to measure your progress.</p>
         <p>The video below details a user accepting and executing a daily challenge and sharing it to their friends.</p>
         <p>Mindrock was the result of a 2-week sprint.</p>
         <p>My role was product manager. Benjamin was our lead developer, Claire our frontend developer and Avery was on the backend.</p>
         <p>We used the WeChat environment to develop (WXML, SCSS and JS) as well as Ruby on Rails to develop our API.</p>
         <p>For more information, or to try the Mini Program, visit www.mindrock.me.</p>

         <p> In the future we would like to incorporate some kind of group negative contract to increase accountability.</p>
