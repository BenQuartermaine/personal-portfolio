<!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->
        <p class="body-content">
          I know what you’re here for. You want to know if we’re a good fit for each other. I’ve got 5 things for you—Work, Tools, Me, Books, Contact.
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Have at it.

<!-- BACKGROUND SECTION -->
        <h3 class="sub-header">Background</h3>
        <p class="body-content">
          I got my start in product design at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://mandalagroup.org">Mandala Group</a>, a company I co-founded in China with two highly inspirational individuals. My role was to co-ordinate the product design team in the research phase. This meant spending weeks at a time in rural Hunan, in the center of China. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          The job role included interviewing village officals and farmers and synethsizing the teams findings into a research report and design breif. The result was <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/mandalagroup.org/videos/2435534026672788/" target="_blank">MoFarm</a>. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Quickly I learnt that understanding the problem space is one aspect, and another equally as important was to be able to communicate the problem space to the whole team. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-content">
          Acknowledging this I have recently undertaken <a class="link" target="_blank" href="#">Le Wagon’s</a> full-stack coding bootcamp to bridge my own knowledge gap between tech and design and relocated to Melbourne, Australia where I am seeking a full-time frontend developer opportunity in a mission oriented company. 
        </p>

        <p class="body-content">
          With focus on different aspects of UX, I have completed the following pieces of work. MoFarm: Rural China research guide, Mirror Fashion and a teardown of Envato Tuts+. These three projects emphasize my thought process and UX principal application.

        <p class="body-content">
          Currently I am working on a personal project called theUXof.xyz. A series of teardowns that explore the user experience of individuals, businesses and products and what make them delightful (or not!).

<!-- OTHER THAN WORK SECTION -->
        <h3 class="sub-header">Other than work</h3>
          <p class="body-content">
            I like to rock climb (the kind without a harness), surf and stay pretty active. I’m a huge believer in screen-free time and interacting with green spaces—living in Shanghai has drilled this luxury home!
          </p> 
          <p class="body-content">
            I enjoy cooking and am currently burning my way through <a class="link" target="_blank" href="#">Bill’s Everyday Asian</a>, and love to step around and smash coffee’s on the weekends.
          </p> 
          <p class="body-content">
            I put a lot of time into learning Mandarin, so I aggressively try to maintain this skill by learning <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXdYi2mHBjI" target="_blank">chinese love songs</a>.
