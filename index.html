          <li>Online option overload is a barrier to purchasing.</li> 
          <li>Product filters are important.</li>

      <div class="case-content">
        <p>Based on user research, 80% of the sample base stated that they really liked clean and minimalist interfaces.</p>
        <p>The core colors chosen were navy blue and a complementary maroon which symbolize depth and tradition. I coupled these with shades of grey and used the core colors sparingly to enable the negative space and photography to stand out.</p>
        <p>The typography selection of a sans-serif font (montserrat) was made to give a fresh feel to the website and break away from the traditonal feeling a serif font can give.</p>
        <p>The message of these selections is that Mirror is an established brand that is in touch with the times. Mirror is showcasing to their existing consumer base that they’re a progressive retailer that is rooted in the fundamentals that made their brand strong.</p>

        <p>For user testing, encouraging a higher level of commentary from the user, and asking probing questions about each page as the test progressed. Also some kind of warm-up activity or question to put the user at ease. I noticed that most seemed unsure and reserved in their actions and statements.</p>

        <div class="case-content">
         <p>In the ever growing and cut-throat job market that Chinese millennials face, confidence toward handling work place situations is their key to success, but many find it hard to define their brand of confidence. They understand it in theory but have trouble applying it, labeling themselves as introverted or ‘Zhai’.</p>
         <p>The goal of this project was to use technology to give recent university graduates a tool to bridge the university to workplace skills gap.</p>

         <p>We spent the first day talking to a range of adults between the age of 23 and 28. The target users were all Chinese millennials.</p>

         <p>About half were university students and the other half are actively seeking employment or currently in their first position after graduating university.</p>

         <p>Our core research question was “How do you feel about the transition from being a student to a full-time employee?”</p>

          <p>From this we learnt a few things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recent graduates feel like they don’t understand workplace norms.</li>
            <li>The standard for professionally communicating and teamwork are poorly understood.</li>

         <p>A possible solution could be negative contracts—for example, pledging a dollar amount at the beginning of a challenge and only receiving it back if they complete all the challenges—or a clearly defined goals system to incentivize the user to see a 7-day challenge through.</p>

          <p>The dashboard page is designed to enable the user to navigate through viewing, listing and booking a jet as well as seeing their history. The idea here is convenience. The Mini Program is intended to aid the user in booking and minimize the time they spend in the app, as we have assumed they’re busy individuals with a high financial opportunity cost.</p>

          <p>The core objective was the adaption of the Airbnb model to WeChat Mini Programs, however given a longer time frame we would have liked to conduct real user interviews and user test our final solution. </p>

          <p>A question raised when presenting CloudSuite was “Are users willing to undertake this kind of service on a mobile device?”. An interesting question that lay at the core of this model.</p>

          <p>Some additional features in the product backlog are a map functionality, detailing where jets are located and an add-to-calendar function once a user has booked a jet.</p>
