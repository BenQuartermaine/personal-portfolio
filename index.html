          <p>Five in-person interviews were conducted. The age range of the interviews was 22 to 28 with a gender break down of three females and two males.From these interviews I understood 5 things:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Online option overload is a barrier to purchasing.</li> 
          <li>Product filters are important.</li>
          <li>Browsing online and purchasing offline is common.</li>
          <li>“Would the clothing fit?”</li> 
          <li>Loyalty depended on the ease of purchasing and discounts.</li>

        <h4>Branding & Color</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="case-content">
        <p>Based on user research, 80% of the sample base stated that they really liked clean and minimalist interfaces.</p>
        <p>The core colors chosen were navy blue and a complementary maroon which symbolize depth and tradition. I coupled these with shades of grey and used the core colors sparingly to enable the negative space and photography to stand out.</p>
        <p>The typography selection of a sans-serif font (montserrat) was made to give a fresh feel to the website and break away from the traditonal feeling a serif font can give.</p>
        <p>The message of these selections is that Mirror is an established brand that is in touch with the times. Mirror is showcasing to their existing consumer base that they’re a progressive retailer that is rooted in the fundamentals that made their brand strong.</p>

          <p>The hi-fidelity wireframes were linked together using InVision and tested on a new set of users.</p>
          <p>User testing uncovered two issues—Design inconsistency’s regarding the “add to bag” page were noted by most and trouble with the design tool and the fact that only a certain user flow could be accessed.</p>
          <p>The second was an issue of time, the first however could be rectified easily.</p>

        <p>There are a few things I would improve with this case study:</p>
        <p>For interviews I would like to first hand watch a users interaction with purchasing a product online.</p>
        <p>For user testing—encouraging a higher level of commentary, and asking probing questions about each page as the test progressed. Also some kind of warm-up activity or question to put the user at ease. I noticed that most were unsure and reserved in their actions and statements.</p>
